    Superclass: vtkWindow
    
    vtkHardwareWindow is an abstract object representing a UI based
    window that can be drawn to. This class is defines an interface that
    GUI specific subclasses (Win32, X, Cocoa) should support.
    
    This class is meant to be Graphics library agnostic. In that it
    should contain as little graphics library specific code as possible,
    ideally none. In contrast to classes such as vtkWinOpenGLRenderWindow
    which contain significant ties to OpenGL.
