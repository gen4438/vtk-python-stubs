    vtkXYPlotWidget - 2D widget for manipulating a XY plot
    
    Superclass: vtkInteractorObserver
    
    This class provides support for interactively manipulating the
    position, size, and orientation of a XY Plot. It listens to Left
    mouse events and mouse movement. It will change the cursor shape
    based on its location. If the cursor is over an edge of thea XY plot
    it will change the cursor shape to a resize edge shape. If the
    position of a XY plot is moved to be close to the center of one of
    the four edges of the viewport, then the XY plot will change its
    orientation to align with that edge. This orientation is sticky in
    that it will stay that orientation until the position is moved close
    to another edge.
