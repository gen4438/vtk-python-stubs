    vtkFillHolesFilter - identify and fill holes in meshes
    
    Superclass: vtkPolyDataAlgorithm
    
    vtkFillHolesFilter is a filter that identifies and fills holes in
    input vtkPolyData meshes. Holes are identified by locating boundary
    edges, linking them together into loops, and then triangulating the
    resulting loops. Note that you can specify an approximate limit to
    the size of the hole that can be filled.
    
    @warning
    Note that any mesh with boundary edges by definition has a
    topological hole. This even includes a reactangular grid (e.g., the
    output of vtkPlaneSource). In such situations, if the outer hole is
    filled, retriangulation of the hole will cause geometric overlap of
    the mesh. This can be prevented by using the hole size instance
    variable to prevent the larger holes from being triangulated.
    
    @warning
    Note this filter only operates on polygons and triangle strips.
    Vertices and polylines are passed through untouched.
