    vtkOStrStreamWrapper - Wrapper for ostrstream.
    
    Internal VTK use only.
    
    Provides a wrapper around the C++ ostrstream class so that VTK source
    files need not include the full C++ streams library.  This is
    intended to prevent cluttering of the translation unit and speed up
    compilation.  Experimentation has revealed between 10% and 60% less
    time for compilation depending on the platform.  This wrapper is used
    by the macros in vtkSetGet.h.
