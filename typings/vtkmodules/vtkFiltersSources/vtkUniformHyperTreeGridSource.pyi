    vtkUniformHyperTreeGridSource - Create a synthetic grid of uniform

    Superclass: vtkHyperTreeGridSource
    
    This class uses input parameters, most notably a string descriptor,
    to generate a vtkHyperTreeGrid instance representing the
    corresponding tree-based AMR grid with uniform root cell sizes along
    each axis.
