    vtkImageBSplineInterpolator - perform b-spline interpolation on images
    
    Superclass: vtkAbstractImageInterpolator
    
    vtkImageBSplineInterpolator can be used to perform b-spline
    interpolation on images that have been filtered with
    vtkImageBSplineCoefficients.  The b-spline interpolants provide the
    maximum possible degree of continuity for a given kernel size, but
    require that the image data be pre-filtered to generate b-spline
    coefficients before the interpolation is performed. Interpolating
    data that has not been pre-filtered will give incorrect results.
