    vtkHyperTreeGridGhostCellsGenerator - Generated ghost cells
    (HyperTree's distributed).
    
    Superclass: vtkHyperTreeGridAlgorithm
    
    This filter generates ghost cells for vtkHyperTreeGrid type data. The
    input vtkHyperTreeGrid should have hyper trees distributed to a
    single process. This filter produces ghost hyper trees at the
    interfaces between different processes, only composed of the nodes
    and leafs at this interface to avoid data waste.
    
    This filter should be used in a multi-processes environment, and is
    only required if wanting to filter a vtkHyperTreeGrid with algorithms
    using Von Neumann or Moore supercursors afterwards.
