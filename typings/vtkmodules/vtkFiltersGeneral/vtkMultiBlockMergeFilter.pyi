    vtkMultiBlockMergeFilter - merges multiblock inputs into a single
    multiblock output
    
    Superclass: vtkMultiBlockDataSetAlgorithm
    
    vtkMultiBlockMergeFilter is an M to 1 filter similar to
    vtkMultiBlockDataGroupFilter. However where as that class creates N
    groups in the output for N inputs, this creates 1 group in the output
    with N datasets inside it. In actuality if the inputs have M blocks,
    this will produce M blocks, each of which has N datasets. Inside the
    merged group, the i'th data set comes from the i'th data set in the
    i'th input.
