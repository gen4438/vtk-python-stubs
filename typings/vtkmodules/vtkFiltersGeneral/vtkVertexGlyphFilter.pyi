    vtkVertexGlyphFilter - Make a vtkPolyData with a vertex on each point.
    
    Superclass: vtkPolyDataAlgorithm
    
    This filter throws away all of the cells in the input and replaces
    them with a vertex on each point.  The intended use of this filter is
    roughly equivalent to the vtkGlyph3D filter, except this filter is
    specifically for data that has many vertices, making the rendered
    result faster and less cluttered than the glyph filter. This filter
    may take a graph or point set as input.
