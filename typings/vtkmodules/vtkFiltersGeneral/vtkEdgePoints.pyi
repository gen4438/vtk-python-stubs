    vtkEdgePoints - generate points on isosurface
    
    Superclass: vtkPolyDataAlgorithm
    
    vtkEdgePoints is a filter that takes as input any dataset and
    generates for output a set of points that lie on an isosurface. The
    points are created by interpolation along cells edges whose
    end-points are below and above the contour value.
    @warning
    vtkEdgePoints can be considered a "poor man's" dividing cubes
    algorithm (see vtkDividingCubes). Points are generated only on the
    edges of cells, not in the interior, and at lower density than
    dividing cubes. However, it is more general than dividing cubes since
    it treats any type of dataset.
