    vtkDataSetGradientPrecompute - Computes a geometry based vector field
    that the DataSetGradient filter uses to accelerate gradient
    computation.
    
    Superclass: vtkDataSetAlgorithm
    
    This vector field is added to FieldData since it has a different
    value for each vertex of each cell (a vertex shared by two cell has
    two different values).
