    vtkMergeArrays - Multiple inputs with one output.
    
    Superclass: vtkPassInputTypeAlgorithm
    
    vtkMergeArrays tries to put all arrays from all inputs into one
    output. The output data object is the same as the first data input.
    The filter checks for a consistent number of points and cells with
    respect to the first input, but does not check any more. Any inputs
    which do not have the correct number of points or cells are ignored
    for that type of data set attribute. When adding new arrays, if there
    is an existing array of the same name and attribute type, the new
    array will have the name mangled to be the original array name plus
    `_input_` where `` is the id/index of the input filter that is
    providing that array.
