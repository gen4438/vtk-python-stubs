    vtkEDLShading - Implement an EDL offscreen shading.
    
    Superclass: vtkDepthImageProcessingPass
    
    Shade the image renderered by its delegate. Two image resolutions are
    used
    
    This pass expects an initialized depth buffer and color buffer.
    Initialized buffers means they have been cleared with farest z-value
    and background color/gradient/transparent color. An opaque pass may
    have been performed right after the initialization.
    
    The delegate is used once.
    
    Its delegate is usually set to a vtkCameraPass or to a
    post-processing pass.
