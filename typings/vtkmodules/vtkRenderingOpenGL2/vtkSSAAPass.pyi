    vtkSSAAPass - Implement Screen Space Anti Aliasing pass.
    
    Superclass: vtkRenderPass
    
    Render to a larger image and then sample down
    
    This pass expects an initialized depth buffer and color buffer.
    Initialized buffers means they have been cleared with farest z-value
    and background color/gradient/transparent color.
    
    The delegate is used once.
    
    Its delegate is usually set to a vtkCameraPass or to a
    post-processing pass.
    
    @par Implementation: As the filter is separable, it first blurs the
    image horizontally and then vertically. This reduces the number of
    texture samples taken.
