    vtkDepthOfFieldPass - Implement a post-processing DOF blur pass.
    
    Superclass: vtkDepthImageProcessingPass
    
    Currently only does behind the focal plane
    
    This pass expects an initialized depth buffer and color buffer.
    Initialized buffers means they have been cleared with farest z-value
    and background color/gradient/transparent color.
    
    The delegate is used once.
    
    Its delegate is usually set to a vtkCameraPass or to a
    post-processing pass.
    
    @par Implementation: As the filter is separable, it first blurs the
    image horizontally and then vertically. This reduces the number of
    texture samples
