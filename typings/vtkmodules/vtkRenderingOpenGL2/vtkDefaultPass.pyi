    vtkDefaultPass - Implement the basic render passes.
    
    Superclass: vtkRenderPass
    
    vtkDefaultPass implements the basic standard render passes of VTK.
    Subclasses can easily be implemented by reusing some parts of the
    basic implementation.
    
    It implements classic Render operations as well as versions with
    property key checking.
    
    This pass expects an initialized depth buffer and color buffer.
    Initialized buffers means they have been cleared with farest z-value
    and background color/gradient/transparent color.
