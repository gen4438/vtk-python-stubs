    vtkOpenGLFXAAPass - Render pass calling the FXAA filter
    
    Superclass: vtkImageProcessingPass
    
    vtkOpenGLFXAAPass is an image post processing render pass. It is a
    fast anti aliasing filter.
    
    This pass usually takes the camera pass as its delegate pass.
    
    ote Currently, this pass wraps the existing FXAA implementation. It
    copies the pixels from the framebuffer to a texture. A better
    approach would be to use the usual render pass workflow to create a
    framebuffer drawing directly on the texture.
