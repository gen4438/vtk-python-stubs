    vtkExtractSelectedIds - extract a list of cells from a dataset
    
    Superclass: vtkExtractSelectionBase
    
    vtkExtractSelectedIds extracts a set of cells and points from within
    a vtkDataSet. The set of ids to extract are listed within a
    vtkSelection. This filter adds a scalar array called
    vtkOriginalCellIds that says what input cell produced each output
    cell. This is an example of a Pedigree ID which helps to trace back
    results. Depending on whether the selection has GLOBALIDS, VALUES or
    INDICES, the selection will use the contents of the array named in
    the GLOBALIDS DataSetAttribute, and arbitrary array, or the position
    (tuple id or number) within the cell or point array.
