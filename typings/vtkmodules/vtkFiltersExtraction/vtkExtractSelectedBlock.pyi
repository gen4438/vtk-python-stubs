    vtkExtractSelectedBlock - Extract-Selection filter to extract blocks.
    
    Superclass: vtkExtractSelectionBase
    
    vtkExtractSelectedBlock extracts blocks from a composite dataset on
    input 0 using a vtkSelection on input 1.
    
    IDs extracted can refer to leaf nodes or non-leaf nodes. When they
    refer to non-leaf nodes, the entire subtree is extracted.
    
    Note: this filter uses `vtkCompositeDataSet::ShallowCopy`, as a
    result, datasets at leaf nodes are simply passed through, rather than
    being shallow-copied themselves.
