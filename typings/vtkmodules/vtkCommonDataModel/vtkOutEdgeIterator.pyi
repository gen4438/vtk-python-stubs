    vtkOutEdgeIterator - Iterates through all outgoing edges from a

    vtkOutEdgeIterator iterates through all edges whose source is a
    particular vertex. Instantiate this class directly and call
    Initialize() to traverse the vertex of a graph. Alternately, use
    GetInEdges() on the graph to initialize the iterator. it->Next()
    returns a vtkOutEdgeType structure, which contains Id, the edge's id, and Target, the
    edge's target vertex.
