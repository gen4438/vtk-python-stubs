    vtkInEdgeIterator - Iterates through all incoming edges to a vertex.
    
    Superclass: vtkObject
    
    vtkInEdgeIterator iterates through all edges whose target is a
    particular vertex. Instantiate this class directly and call
    Initialize() to traverse the vertex of a graph. Alternately, use
    GetInEdges() on the graph to initialize the iterator. it->Next()
    returns a vtkInEdgeType structure, which contains Id, the edge's id, and Source, the
    edge's source vertex.
