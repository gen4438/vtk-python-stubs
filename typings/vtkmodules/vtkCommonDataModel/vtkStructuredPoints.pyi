    vtkStructuredPoints - A subclass of ImageData.
    
    Superclass: vtkImageData
    
    StructuredPoints is a subclass of ImageData that requires the data
    extent to exactly match the update extent. Normall image data allows
    that the data extent may be larger than the update extent.
    StructuredPoints also defines the origin differently that
    vtkImageData. For structured points the origin is the location of
    first point. Whereas images define the origin as the location of
    point 0, 0, 0. Image Origin is stored in ivar, and structured points
    have special methods for setting/getting the origin/extents.
