    vtkXMLStructuredGridReader reads the VTK XML StructuredGrid file
    format.  One structured grid file can be read to produce one output. 
    Streaming is supported.  The standard extension for this reader's
    file format is "vts".  This reader is also used to read a single
    piece of the parallel file format.
