    vtkAppendArcLength - appends Arc length for input poly lines.
    
    Superclass: vtkPolyDataAlgorithm
    
    vtkAppendArcLength is used for filter such as plot-over-line. In such
    cases, we need to add an attribute array that is the arc_length over
    the length of the probed line. That's when vtkAppendArcLength can be
    used. It adds a new point-data array named "arc_length" with the
    computed arc length for each of the polylines in the input. For all
    other cell types, the arc length is set to 0.
    @warning
    This filter assumes that cells don't share points.
