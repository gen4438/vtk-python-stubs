    vtkExtractPoints - extract points within an implicit function
    
    Superclass: vtkPointCloudFilter
    
    vtkExtractPoints removes points that are either inside or outside of
    a vtkImplicitFunction. Implicit functions in VTK defined as function
    of the form f(x,y,z)=c, where values c<=0 are interior values of the
    implicit function. Typical examples include planes, spheres,
    cylinders, cones, etc. plus boolean combinations of these functions.
    (This operation presumes closure on the set, so points on the
    boundary are also considered to be inside.)
    
    Note that while any vtkPointSet type can be provided as input, the
    output is represented by an explicit representation of points via a
    vtkPolyData. This output polydata will populate its instance of
    vtkPoints, but no cells will be defined (i.e., no vtkVertex or
    vtkPolyVertex are contained in the output). Also, after filter
    execution, the user can request a vtkIdType* map which indicates how
    the input points were mapped to the output. A value of map[i] (where
    i is the ith input point) less than 0 means that the ith input point
    was removed. (See also the superclass documentation for accessing the
    removed points through the filter's second output.)
    
    @warning
    This class has been threaded with vtkSMPTools. Using TBB or other
    non-sequential type (set in the CMake variable
    VTK_SMP_IMPLEMENTATION_TYPE) may improve performance significantly.
    
    @warning
    The vtkExtractEnclosedPoints filter can be used to extract points
    inside of a volume defined by a manifold, closed polygonal surface.
    This filter however is much slower than methods based on implicit
    functions (like this filter).
