    vtkTreeMapLayoutStrategy - abstract superclass for all tree map
    layout strategies
    
    Superclass: vtkAreaLayoutStrategy
    
    All subclasses of this class perform a tree map layout on a tree.
    This involves assigning a rectangular region to each vertex in the
    tree, and placing that information in a data array with four
    components per tuple representing (Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, Ymax).
    
    Instances of subclasses of this class may be assigned as the layout
    strategy to vtkTreeMapLayout
    
    @par Thanks: Thanks to Brian Wylie and Ken Moreland from Sandia
    National Laboratories for help developing this class.
