    Superclass: vtkCompositeDataPipeline
    
    vtkThreadedCompositeDataPipeline processes a composite data object in
    parallel using the SMP framework. It does this by creating a vector
    of data objects (the pieces of the composite data) and processing
    them using vtkSMPTools::For. Note that this requires that the
    algorithm implement all pipeline passes in a re-entrant way. It
    should store/retrieve all state changes using input and output
    information objects, which are unique to each thread.
