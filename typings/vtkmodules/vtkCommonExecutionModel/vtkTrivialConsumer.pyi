    vtkTrivialConsumer - Consumer to consume data off of a pipeline.

    vtkTrivialConsumer caps off a pipeline so that no output data is left
    hanging around when a pipeline executes when data is set to be
    released (see vtkDataObject::SetGlobalReleaseDataFlag). This is
    intended to be used for tools such as Catalyst and not end users.
