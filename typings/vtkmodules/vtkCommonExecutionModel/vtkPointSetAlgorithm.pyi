    vtkPointSetAlgorithm - Superclass for algorithms that produce output

    Superclass: vtkAlgorithm
    
    vtkPointSetAlgorithm is a convenience class to make writing
    algorithms easier. It is also designed to help transition old
    algorithms to the new pipeline architecture. There are some
    assumptions and defaults made by this class you should be aware of.
    This class defaults such that your filter will have one input port
    and one output port. If that is not the case simply change it with
    SetNumberOfInputPorts etc. See this classes constructor for the
    default. This class also provides a FillInputPortInfo method that by
    default says that all inputs will be PointSet. If that isn't the case
    then please override this method in your subclass. You should
    implement the subclass's algorithm into RequestData( request,
    inputVec, outputVec).
